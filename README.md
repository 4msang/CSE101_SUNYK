# CSE101_SUNYK
# Lab 7 Problem 3

1. Copy and paste maxprofit_template.py to your maxprofit.py in PyCharm
2. Delete 'pass' under def solution(A): and fill in your code
3. Compare your output to the expected output, noted as a comment (#) next to each runs at the bottom
+ Note) If you wrote an inefficient algorithm, it will take quite a time to run the last 3 tests.
